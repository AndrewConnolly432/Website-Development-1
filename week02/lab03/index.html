        <p>Jack is a very curious individual. When he's not busy telling <i>bad jokes</i> to his friends, he's <i>pulling pranks</i> on people with various props like cardboard boxes. Despite that, he has a <i>heart of gold</i> aand deeply cares for his friends and family</p>
        <p>Anyone who has lost track of time when using a computer knows the propensity to dream, the urge to make dreams come true and the tendency to miss lunch, from Tim Berners-Lee.
